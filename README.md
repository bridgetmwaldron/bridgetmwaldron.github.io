# Bridget's Data Storytelling Portfolio 
My name is Bridget Waldron. I'm a senior studying Accounting and Business Information Systems. This summer during my Forensic Technology Internship with EY I was shown how important Data Visuaization is. I'm excited to further my skills in this area as I hope to be an asset to my future team when it comes to analyzing client data and producing an engaging story. I have greatly enjoyed this class this semester eventhough it has proved to be one of my more difficulat courses I've taken. I've had to push myself each week to learn new skills and dive into a different technology. I always appreciated Professor Jia's positive attitude and eagerness to engage us each and every class.

# Google Virtual Tour: My Restaraunt Experience
Working in restaraunts has shaped me as a person and so I felt it would be fitting to do a tour of the places I've grown a lot as a person. I put together a Virtual Tour of the restaraunt I currently work at. I walk you through the outside, and the bring you inside to the dining rooms, the kitchen, and the second floor. Torre has so many cool and intriguing features from the tequlia tower with 100 bottles displayed on it to the wall of authentic sugar skulls. I ended the tour at my Family's restaraunt, the LBI Pancake House, which I talked about during show and tell!

# Tableau Dashboard Project: Childcare and Child Poverty 
Through my group project with Tommy Horgan and Mercy Mirembe, I focused my analysis on the relationship between Public Spending on Chilcare and Child Poverty Rates in different countries. This visualization compares Public spending on Childcare with Child Poverty rates for 36 different countries. The size of the dots correspond to the amount each country spends on Childcare.
