# Bridget's Data Storytelling Portfolio 
My name is Bridget Waldron. I'm a senior studying Accounting and Business Information Systems. This summer during my Forensic Technology Internship with EY I was shown how important Data Visuaization is. I'm excited to further my skills in this area as I hope to be an asset to my future team when it comes to analyzing client data and producing an engaging story. I have greatly enjoyed this class this semester eventhough it has proved to be one of my more difficulat courses I've taken. I've had to push myself each week to learn new skills and dive into a different technology. I always appreciated Professor Jia's positive attitude and eagerness to engage us each and every class.
