# Bridget's Data Storytelling Portfolio 
My name is Bridget Waldron. I'm a senior studying Accounting and Business Information Systems. This summer during my Forensic Technology Internship with EY I was shown how important Data Visuaization is. I'm excited to further my skills in this area as I hope to be an asset to my future team when it comes to analyzing client data and producing an engaging story. I have greatly enjoyed this class this semester eventhough it has proved to be one of my more difficulat courses I've taken. I've had to push myself each week to learn new skills and dive into a different technology. I always appreciated Professor Jia's positive attitude and eagerness to engage us each and every class.

# Charts with DataWrapper: The Number of Women in Congress
I love learning about U.S. History and Women's impact on Politics throughout history. I created this chart to show the number of Women Senators and Respresentatives in Congress overtime. It starts at the 65th Congress, which initiated its term in 1917, because this was the first Congress to have a female member, Rep. Jeannette Rankin. The stacked bars show in dark blue the number of women in the Senate and the lighter blue shows the number of Women in The House. Currently in the 117th Congress, there are 143 Women serving in total, but specifically 24 in the Senate and 119 in The House. These numbers are small compared to the 535 total members of Congress. I hope we see these numbers continue to grow. This data comes from [Rutger's Center for American Women and Politics.](https://cawpdata.rutgers.edu/women-elected-officials/position?position%5B%5D=Governor&position%5B%5D=Lt+Governor&current=1&yearend_filter=All&items_per_page=50/ "Women Elected Officials by Position")

# Google Virtual Tour: My Restaraunt Experience
Working in restaraunts has shaped me as a person and so I felt it would be fitting to do a tour of the places I've grown a lot as a person. I put together a Virtual Tour of the restaraunt I currently work at. I walk you through the outside, and the bring you inside to the dining rooms, the kitchen, and the second floor. Torre has so many cool and intriguing features from the tequlia tower with 100 bottles displayed on it to the wall of authentic sugar skulls. I ended the tour at my Family's restaraunt, the LBI Pancake House, which I talked about during show and tell! Check out [Torre's](https://www.torrerestaurant.com/ "Torre") menu and their gallery for more pictures!

# Visualizing Social Media Data with ArcGis: Tweets about the Kardashians
I am a huge fan of Keeping Up With the Kardashians and when deciding what topic to source tweets on I figured why not see the tweets about the most famous family in America. The Kardashians are constantly being talked and tweeted about so the key terms "Kardashian" and "Jenner" turned up lots of results. Below is a heat map I created with ArcGis displaying the locations of where the Kardashians are being tweeted about. Not suprisingly there were hot spots in NYC and LA two populous area but also areas that the Kardashian/Jenners frequent. I scraped this data from ShinyApps/TwitterUSA. Take a look at the map below!

# Tableau Dashboard Project: Childcare and Child Poverty 
Through my group project with Tommy Horgan and Mercy Mirembe on women's equality in the workplace and the importance of childcare, I focused my analysis on the relationship Child Poverty Rates and Public Spending on Chilcare and Women's Involvement in the labor force in different countries. The first visualization compares Public spending on Childcare with Child Poverty rates for 36 different countries. The size of the dots correspond to the amount each country spends on Childcare, the more they spend the bigger the dot. The main insight or takeway from this visualization is that Public Spending on Childcare directly impacts Child Poverty rates. The countries that spent more on Childcare has lower rates of Child Poverty. Another main insight that is apparent in this visualization is the geographical correlation in the results. Many Scandinavian countries are the ones that are in the bottom corner, meaning they have the lowest Child Poverty rates and the highest public spending on Childcare. The second visualization compares Child Poverty rates with the % of Womens Involvement in the labor force. While these graph are visually inversed they display the same trends. The countries wth the higher % of Women in involved in the labor forced the lower the child poverty rates. Addiottionally we see the same Scandinavian countries highlighted in the top corner. Ultimatley what these graphs emphasize is that supporting women and families, enabling them to work lowers child poverty. 
I sourced this data from [The Economic Policy Institute.](https://www.epi.org/publication/countries-investing-more-in-social-programs-have-less-child-poverty// "Countries investing more in social programs have less child poverty")

# Tableau Interactive Maps: Female Governors and Lt. Governors in the U.S.
I created this Interactive Map Visualization to show and help users learn more about Female State Leaders across the United States. I have always been inspired and empowered by women in politics. I think it is so crucial to highlight and learn about these women who are leaders in states across the country. I had no idea some of the states that did and did not have a female Governor or Lt. Governor. The colors signify their political party, red for Republican and blue for democrat. I hope one day soon this map will be at least 50% highlighted. Right now there are only 8 Female Governors and 19 Lt. Governors.
